# MVP-Template

When we follow MVP architecture pattern we always come across a small but repetitive task to create basic files like Android Activity, Presenter, View, Api models and then writing boiler plate code. This usually takes 30-60 minutes for each single screen. To ease out work and save time I have created an automated template which will do above work in less than 10 seconds.

### How to Install

Clone the MVPActivity Repo then paste the MVPActivity folder at below location.
1. Windows - C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\plugins\android\lib\templates\activities
2. Mac - /Applications/Android/Studio.app/Contents/plugins/android/lib/templates/activities

Restart the Android Studio.


### How to use  

Select the folder under which you want to create a new MVP folder. right click => New = > Activity = > MVPActivity .
write th sub Package Name and Prefix Name (This name will be appended before the name of the generated calsses Ex: if Prefix name is 'Login'
         this will generate LoginActivity, LoginPresenter, LoginInteractor, LoginView).
